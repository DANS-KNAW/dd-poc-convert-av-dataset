SYNOPSIS \u00b6 dd-poc-convert-av-dataset <in> <out> DESCRIPTION \u00b6 PoC for a tool that will help with the migration of AV datasets from EASY to the Data Stations. INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION \u00b6 Currently, this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL8 compatible OSes and later. The RPM will install the binaries to /opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-poc-convert-av-dataset and the configuration files to /etc/opt/dans.knaw.nl/dd-poc-convert-av-dataset . The configuration options are documented by comments in the default configuration file config.yml . To install the module on systems that do not support RPM, you can copy and unarchive the tarball to the target host. You will have to take care of placing the files in the correct locations for your system yourself. For instructions on building the tarball, see next section. BUILDING FROM SOURCE \u00b6 Prerequisites: Java 17 or higher Maven 3.6.3 or higher RPM Steps: git clone https://github.com/DANS-KNAW/dd-poc-convert-av-dataset.git cd dd-poc-convert-av-dataset mvn clean install If the rpm executable is found at /usr/local/bin/rpm , the build profile that includes the RPM packaging will be activated. If rpm is available, but at a different path, then activate it by using Maven's -P switch: mvn -Pprm install . Alternatively, to build the tarball execute: mvn clean install assembly:single","title":"Manual"},{"location":"#dd-poc-convert-av-dataset","text":"Converts an exported EASY dataset to an AV deposit.","title":"dd-poc-convert-av-dataset"},{"location":"#synopsis","text":"dd-poc-convert-av-dataset <in> <out>","title":"SYNOPSIS"},{"location":"#description","text":"PoC for a tool that will help with the migration of AV datasets from EASY to the Data Stations.","title":"DESCRIPTION"},{"location":"#installation-and-configuration","text":"Currently, this project is built as an RPM package for RHEL8 compatible OSes and later.
